            <li data-aos="fade-up">
              <strong>Seal Your Driveway Regularly:</strong> A high-quality sealant protects your concrete from moisture, cracking, 
              and weather damage. Apply every 1–2 years to keep your driveway looking great.
            </li>
            <li data-aos="fade-up">
              <strong>Clean Regularly:</strong> Remove dirt, oil stains, and debris to prevent surface damage. Use a gentle cleaner 
              and consider power washing for a deep clean twice a year.
            </li>
            <li data-aos="fade-up">
              <strong>Repair Cracks Promptly:</strong> Small cracks can worsen over time. Use a concrete filler or contact a local 
              contractor to patch larger cracks and prevent further issues.
            </li>
            <li data-aos="fade-up">
              <strong>Address Drainage Issues:</strong> Ensure proper drainage to avoid water pooling on your driveway, which can cause 
              cracks and erosion.
            </li>
            <li data-aos="fade-up">
              <strong>Limit Heavy Loads:</strong> Avoid parking large vehicles or machinery on your driveway to prevent stress and damage 
              to the surface.
